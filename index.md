### Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website

Hey Cosmonauts!

Meet the new Citizen Cosmos website. Yes... it took us longer than usual to come to this, but as they say 'Rome was not built in a day' (just for the record: it might have been, the hosts don't know this for sure).

We know, you're super curious as to why it took us that long to achieve this. And here is the 101: at first we were building our own website from scratch. Small correction: [Sergey](https://www.citizencosmos.space/hosts/sergey) was pretending to be a web designer, but that really didn't work out as planned. Joking aside, the idea with having a website built from scratch is great, though it requires a lot of initial input, design and a thorough up keeping. The latter was the trigger decision against it.

Just when we thought that all was lost, we stumbled upon Fireside and so far we really like it. The cost-quality and time-consumption overweight all the cons. The biggest con, of course, not being `100%` in charge of the content, it can be blocked, etc. For this we are planning to host some kind of a simple 'mirror' on IPFS in the (not-so near) future for the blog posts and a content menu. And, we already publish each of our episodes to IPFS, using [cyber.page](https://cyber.page/search/citizen%20cosmos).

In reality a lot more is planned in that direction, and we decided start somewhere, rather than to endlessly feature-w$$k over the future.

Feedback and comments are most welcome! The best place to leave comments is [here](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Citizen-Cosmos/issues/17). If the issue is already closed, feel free to open a new one. We like issues.

### Citizen Cosmos is taking over the fuckgoolge validator on the Cosmos hub and launching a brand

Dear Citizens of Cosmos,

Citizen Cosmos is pleased to announce the taking over and the rebranding of the 'fuckgoogle' Cosmos hub validator into the Citizen Cosmos validator! In [a recent post](https://cybercongress.ai/fuckgoogle-validator/) the team of the 'fuckgoogle' validator announced the start of the migration process. We would like to confirm this from our side.

What will happen and what can be expected?

Recently the validator got a delegation of 425,000 ATOMs from the Tendermint team. After talks with Tendermint, they have agreed to upkeep the delegation in the light of recognizing the work that Citizen Cosmos does for the Cosmos hub.

This work includes:
- The Citizen Cosmos podcast
- Managing of the [@cosmos_rus](https://twitter.com/cosmos_rus) Twitter page
- Managing the [Cosmos Moscow meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Cosmos-Moscow) (so far we helped to organize and manage 2 educational events)
- Managing the [RU-based Cosmos news channel](https://t.me/cosmosinrussian) on Telegram
- Ongoing help with translating and spreading the RU version of Today in Cosmos (@cosmos_rus)
- Active involvement in the community of Cosmos

What can be expected:
A complete rebranding of the validator after the migration process is finished. Sergey has already launched another validator on the Cyber network, which will also undergo a rebranding to the Citizen Cosmos brand, and in the future might act as a relayer bridge between the 2 networks, once IBC is up.

We have a lot of plans for the validator, specifically in the light of the work we are prepared to do within Cosmos hub and are pleased that things have turned out this way. The journey won't be easy, but we will defiantly get there and have a lot planned! 

Please keep up with our announcements, as we hope to publish the roadmap, for the newly created Citizen Cosmos brand in the next few weeks.

May the code be with us =)

### New team members onboard Citizen Cosmos 

The branding of Citizen Cosmos that [was announced a few weeks ago](https://www.citizencosmos.space/articles/validator-and-brand), has been gradually progressing. The branding included the revamping of the Citizen Cosmos podcast into a web3 brand. With the kick-off of its own [validator](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) and the re-organization the public work we do with Cosmos Moscow, public docs, etc.

This included migrations, infrastructure set up, planning of tasks and, of course expanding the Citizen Cosmos greater team. Without any more ado... We are proud to share with the public, that our team has doubled and 2 more people have joined our team.

[@mrlp4](https://github.com/mrlp4) is helping us as a DevOps and [@nj](https://github.com/johnniecosmos) is the Citizen Cosmos community advocate. We are over the moon with these updates and are very excited to carry on building the community around Citizen Cosmos. 

### Ecosystem comparison: Cosmos VS Polkadot ep.I

#### TL;DR
Blockchain interoperability, the final frontier!

Here at [Citizen Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/), we love decentralization and have decided to make a, somewhat timely, report and compare the current state of the 2 largest interoperability ecosystems: [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) VS [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

Our goal is not to start a holy war. Our goal is to try and stay as objective as we can with regard to the information we provide. If you happen to find any mistakes, or you think the data should be updated, please do not hesitate to contact us via [e-mail](mailto:citizencosmos@rocketship.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/blog). We believe that blockchains have already changed the world and a little competitiveness between the top projects can only help to make the world more decentralized!

For transparency purposes, the reader should note that we run [a validator](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) on the Cosmos hub, and we have a personal stake in both networks in question, Cosmos and Polkadot. We also hold stakes in some mentioned projects in this report.

### Comparison
_Ecosystem comparison_

Table 1

_Selected project comparison_

Before we go into this, keep in mind that to make such a comparison is always an unthankful and an unforgivable deed to do. 

Firsthand, we selected the projects based on how we see fit, which might not be like the reader will see fit to do. Second of all, to compare projects head to head, even if they fit into one category (i.e. oracles), is just impossible to do without being selective. It’s like asking Spider-Man or Iron Man? Tarantino or Guy Richie? Lennon or Elvis? It's just different things, but we can still have a discussion and compare them based on selected criteria. 

Our method fell on randomly selecting 10 projects from each ecosystem. Not top to bottom, not bottom to top, not in alphabetical order, but based on a basic user story. 

We tried to imagine that we were an average crypto Chad, following random aggregator links, such as [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/cosmos-ecosystem), [Messari](https://messari.io/screener/polkadot-ecosystem-FC931505), [polkaproejct](https://polkaproject.com/), [cosmos-cap](https://cosmos-cap.com/#/), etc and just clicking some of the names that we have heard mentioned elsewhere. After all, we believe that is exactly how our brain functions. Something rings a bell and you start to investigate. You then begin your research, evaluate the project, and voilà… you just ended up buying the extra size fries and the apple pie, although you came in, just for the burger.

Please note that we specifically didn't take the obvious big names, such as Kusama, Binance chain, Link, etc. For the sake of our crypto Chad, let's call him Bob, we will imagine that he already knows enough about these projects.

Nevertheless, we did what we did. Feel free to comment and keep in mind that this is meant to be educational, rather than anything else.

### Conclusions
Gotcha! 

We don’t have any, or rather, we think it’s wrong to draw out conclusions for someone else, especially due to the fact that the purpose of this report is strictly educational, and we already said that this comparison is made, based on Bob’s random pickings. 

Our goal is to push competitiveness forward and not to start any holy wars, we hope that you join Bob in the long term.

We believe that both - Cosmos and Polkadot, are uber important for the success of decentralization, and even more so, we believe that there are many, open, decentralized, censorship-free and great projects that exist out in the wild. 

Enjoy discovering them and always DYOR!  

### P.S.
We hope you have enjoyed this report. If you did, you can show your support by tuning in into the [Citizen Cosmos podcast](https://www.citizencosmos.space/episodes) to learn more about web3 and the motivation of those who are building it.

We would love it if you could help us to improve this report. Either [email us](mailto:citizencosmos@rocketship.com) or submit [a pull request](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/blog) if you think you know how to improve the report.
