### Ecosystem comparison: Cosmos VS Polkadot ep.I

#### TL;DR
Blockchain interoperability, the final frontier!

Here at [Citizen Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/), we love decentralization and have decided to make a, somewhat timely, report and compare the current state of the 2 largest interoperability ecosystems: [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) VS [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

Our goal is not to start a holy war. Our goal is to try and stay as objective as we can with regard to the information we provide. If you happen to find any mistakes, or you think the data should be updated, please do not hesitate to contact us via [e-mail](mailto:citizencosmos@rocketship.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/blog). We believe that blockchains have already changed the world and a little competitiveness between the top projects can only help to make the world more decentralized!

For transparency purposes, the reader should note that we run [a validator](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) on the Cosmos hub, and we have a personal stake in both networks in question, Cosmos and Polkadot. We also hold stakes in some mentioned projects in this report.

### Comparison

_Selected project comparison_

Before we go into this, keep in mind that to make such a comparison is always an unthankful and an unforgivable deed to do. 

Firsthand, we selected the projects based on how we see fit, which might not be like the reader will see fit to do. Second of all, to compare projects head to head, even if they fit into one category (i.e. oracles), is just impossible to do without being selective. It’s like asking Spider-Man or Iron Man? Tarantino or Guy Richie? Lennon or Elvis? It's just different things, but we can still have a discussion and compare them based on selected criteria. 

Our method fell on randomly selecting 10 projects from each ecosystem. Not top to bottom, not bottom to top, not in alphabetical order, but based on a basic user story. 

We tried to imagine that we were an average crypto Chad, following random aggregator links, such as [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/cosmos-ecosystem), [Messari](https://messari.io/screener/polkadot-ecosystem-FC931505), [polkaproejct](https://polkaproject.com/), [cosmos-cap](https://cosmos-cap.com/#/), etc and just clicking some of the names that we have heard mentioned elsewhere. After all, we believe that is exactly how our brain functions. Something rings a bell and you start to investigate. You then begin your research, evaluate the project, and voilà… you just ended up buying the extra size fries and the apple pie, although you came in, just for the burger.

Please note that we specifically didn't take the obvious big names, such as Kusama, Binance chain, Link, etc. For the sake of our crypto Chad, let's call him Bob, we will imagine that he already knows enough about these projects.

Nevertheless, we did what we did. Feel free to comment and keep in mind that this is meant to be educational, rather than anything else.

### Conclusions
Gotcha! 

We don’t have any, or rather, we think it’s wrong to draw out conclusions for someone else, especially due to the fact that the purpose of this report is strictly educational, and we already said that this comparison is made, based on Bob’s random pickings. 

Our goal is to push competitiveness forward and not to start any holy wars, we hope that you join Bob in the long term.

We believe that both - Cosmos and Polkadot, are uber important for the success of decentralization, and even more so, we believe that there are many, open, decentralized, censorship-free and great projects that exist out in the wild. 

Enjoy discovering them and always DYOR!
