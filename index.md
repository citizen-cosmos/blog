### Ecosystem comparison: Cosmos VS Polkadot ep.I

#### TL;DR
Blockchain interoperability, the final frontier!

Here at [Citizen Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/), we love decentralization and have decided to make a, somewhat timely, report and compare the current state of the 2 largest interoperability ecosystems: [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) VS [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

Our goal is not to start a holy war. Our goal is to try and stay as objective as we can with regard to the information we provide. If you happen to find any mistakes, or you think the data should be updated, please do not hesitate to contact us via [e-mail](mailto:citizencosmos@rocketship.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/blog). We believe that blockchains have already changed the world and a little competitiveness between the top projects can only help to make the world more decentralized!

For transparency purposes, the reader should note that we run [a validator](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper1e859xaue4k2jzqw20cv6l7p3tmc378pc3k8g2u) on the Cosmos hub, and we have a personal stake in both networks in question, Cosmos and Polkadot. We also hold stakes in some mentioned projects in this report.
